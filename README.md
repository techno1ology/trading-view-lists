Import lists for trading view

### Binance Lists
<p>
  I created a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/51n7zot0/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a> to pull the exchange information.
  I filter out all inactive pairs and stable coins
</p>
<p>
  The Binance API does not support CORS so I copy the JSON from the <a href="https://api.binance.com/api/v1/exchangeInfo" target="_blank">Binance API</a>
  to <a href="https://api.myjson.com/bins/nlj8g" target="_blank">myjson</a> before running the script.
</p>

### Setup
1. __Open the list you want to download and click the raw button__

4. __Note: To delete a list it can be the currently selected list. See here binance-usdt is my current list and the delete x icon shows up to all me to delete binance-btc__

When I update my list here, I just download all 3 three, delete all 3 from Tading View and Import the new ones.  Enjoy!
